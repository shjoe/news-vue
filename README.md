## Dev update 5.26
API calls currently return `articles` array. Will need to address and format so that articles are displayed in individual cards that include: title/link, source, and short description.

In the future, the main page will have top headlines and a second page will include the search box.

## Instructions for working with this application

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```

**Note:** This application has been configured to build files to the `/docs` directory, making it compatible with the "Serve from `master` `/docs` directory" setting for GitHub Pages. Please adjust your GH Pages settings accordingly on your repository settings page.
